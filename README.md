# GLTutorial
Implementing an OpenGL program in Visual Studio C++ based on a tutorial.

The tutorial itself is by Joey Clover and can be found in three parts here:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-55D2rsCSE
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXszif5CoB0
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C4IVJapPMM

Note that I used relative inculde and lib paths. So, you should be able to build the code without any hassles. 

There is also one note about the tutorial itself. If you are follwoing it part by part, in part 2, you may not see the white trangle because some machines do require shaders. in that case, continue implementing the third part.
